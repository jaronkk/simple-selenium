# Selenium Wrapper + RSpec examples

This project acts as a starting point for using Ruby and Selenium to add functional testing to a project.

## Requirements

Ruby + RubyGems
The Ruby bindings for [Selenium WebDriver](http://seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) (gem install selenium-webdriver)
[RSpec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec) (gem install rspec)

## Usage

To run the tests, simply cd into the root directory and run `rspec`.  This will run the tests in the spec/functional/example_spec.rb file.
